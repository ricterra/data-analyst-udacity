# Data Analyst Projects by Udacity

Data Analyst nanodegree is an online course provided by Udacity. This program is an intensive course for the data analyst with real-life projects using Python via Jupyter Notebook. The course is structured in 4 parts: Introduction to Python, Statistics and A/B Tests, Data Wrangling and Data Visualization.

### Project 1

Brief description: Estabilish SQL queries to extract climate data from DB (temperature vs time), read data in jupyter-notebook and create simple visualizations. It's also recommended to use average mean to smooth the dataset for a better plot visualization. At the end, a report must be done with the final remarks.

### Project 2

Brief description: This project was dedicated to analyze the No-Show-Appointments data in order to detect hidden features/patterns of why some groups of people just miss a medical appointment. Dataset includes an encoded pacient ID, schedule day, appointment day, age and some pre-existent diseases. I started by looking at the general traits of the data, then I performed the necessary wrangling and cleaning. At last, I plotted some graphs for better visualization and conclusions.

### Project 3

Brief description: For this project, the aim is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The results might help an online store to decide if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

### Project 4

Brief description: The aim of this work is to go through all steps of data wrangling, that is, gather, assess, clean, store and analyze a whole dataframe. Important notice that this dataframe is full of flaws and inconsistent data so we have a chance to pratice the skills I’ve learned during this course. In order to complete this project I've had to estabilish a Twitter API using Tweepy and accessing a developer account.

### Project 5

Brief description: An exploratory data analysis was built on a data set from Prosper, which is America’s first marketplace lending platform, with many billion in funded loans. This data set contains about 114k loans with 81 variables on each loan, e.g., loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, estimated loss, borrower state and many other usefull stuff. The aim of this project is to analyze how financial data and personal data from borrowers and lenders can affect the loan status and to get some insights about the relationships among multiple variables using statistics and data visualizations.
