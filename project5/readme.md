# Prosper Loan Data Exploration

### Abstract

Inside this document you will find all exploratory analysis and explanatory questions with regards to dataframe.
The first part is dedicated to explore some general aspects of data and find some hidden patterns. Then a deeper analysis is performed in order to plot graphs to explain trends and observations. At last final remarks is posed and a conclusion of our entire analysis is achieved.
By analyzing this dataset it became clear that the prosper rating is a variable that mix many measurements in order to achieve a risk grade. Generally speaking, higher grades represents either rich people or people with very stable wages. Otherwise, lower rates represents the opposite, either poor people or indebted people.
Loan count plays a big role along the years, we can speculate that it was strong affected by the financial crisis of 08', and while USA begins its economical recovery efforts for the next years so the loan count was increased. We could also see that rich states such as: California, Texas, New York and Florida were more proeminent resulting in a higher loan count along this timeseries. 
Most of the loans were conceded to mid prosper ratings taking into account both Alpha (AA-A-B-C-D-HR) and Numeric (1 to 11). Moreover the average wage of a typical borrower were about 25k up to 75k, with a lower count for richer and poorer than this range. 

### Introduction

This project is the final part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. An exploratory data analysis was built on a data set from Prosper, which is Americaâ€™s first marketplace lending platform, with many billion in funded loans. This data set contains about 114k (113,937) loans with 81 variables on each loan, e.g., loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan  status, borrower income, borrower employment status, estimated loss, borrower state and many other usefull stuff.


### Objectives

The aim of this project is to analyze how financial data and personal data from borrowers and lenders can affect the loan status and to get some insights about the relationships among multiple variables using statistics and data visualizations.
